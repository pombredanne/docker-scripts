# Environment variables

Below you can find environment variables you can set while using this tool.

## `DOCKER_TIMEOUT`

Default value: `600`

Specifies time (in seconds) to wait for the Docker daemon to prepare a response to an API call
we make. In most cases this is not important, but you may consider to bump this value if
your Docker engine is busy.

Most resource consuming call is exporting the image tar from daemon. If you build parallel
some images and/or export more images at the same time -- Docker can fail to prepare the archive
in time and you'll see a timeout. This squash tool will retry (3 times) to fetch it, but sometimes
you want to make the timeout a bit higher.

## `DOCKER_CONNECTION`

Default value: `unix://var/run/docker.sock`

Connection string to the Docker daemon. You will not be required to change this if
you use default installation of Docker, which creates the socket at `/var/run/docker.sock`.
If you do use custom Docker daemon settings or connect to a remote Docker daemon --
update this environment variable.
